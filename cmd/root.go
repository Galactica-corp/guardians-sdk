	Short: "galactica-guardian is a CLI tool for managing and verifying user data on the Galactica blockchain",
	Long: `galactica-guardian is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for
guardians in the Galactica blockchain ecosystem. Guardians play a pivotal role
in verifying and managing user data on the blockchain. 

In the initial stage, galactica-guardian primarily focuses on Know Your
Customer (KYC) verification. Users can visit the Galactica website or app to
input their personal information. Guardians then perform document verification
using national IDs, passports, or driver's licenses. Once verified, guardians
issue zkKYC attestations on-chain, which are stored in a Merkle tree registry.

As Galactica evolves, guardians will have the capability to issue various
other attestations, such as ZkCerts for education diplomas, gym memberships,
conference tickets, and more. This CLI empowers guardians to efficiently
manage these verification processes and maintain a secure and trusted
ecosystem.

For detailed usage instructions, available commands, and options, please refer
to the respective sections in the documentation.
