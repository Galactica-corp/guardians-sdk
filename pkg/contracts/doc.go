// Package contracts provides a set of abstractions and utilities for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts,
// specifically the ones that are required for type-safe blockchain interaction in this SDK.
//
// The package includes metadata, ABIs, and various entities for these contracts, allowing users to conveniently
// work with Ethereum contracts associated with guardian roles, KYC records, and related events. It encapsulates
// the complexity of contract interactions and facilitates the integration of Ethereum smart contract
// functionality into Go applications.
